## What's this?
binfiles is a repo containing my bash hacks. So far, it's just one: colors.

# colors
colors is a shell file that pretty-prints out all the colors your terminal can show. It includes relevant numbers like the 256-color code or the bash escape sequence. It has three modes:

## -fg
Prints 256 colors. Shows the color on the numbers themselves.

## -bg
Prints 256 colors on the background behind the numbers.

## -bash
Prints 16 colors with the relevant bash escape sequences. Shows all foreground colors on all background colors.
